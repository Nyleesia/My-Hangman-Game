# My-Hangman-Game
This is my third assignment in the GA TECH Bootcamp. 
I absolutely love the challenge! I hate it at times, but that only happens when I am frustrated (i.e. learning). 
I guess I am a bit like Bart Simpson. 
</br>
In reality, though, I enjoy figuring out how things work.
</br>
This assignment required the developer, (using vanilla(my fav flavor) JavaScript, to build a word
guess game (essentially hangman). 
</br>
</br>
My code breaks/doesn't work as I would like, when I ask it to "quit(exit game)" while on a page hosted by github
(this is expected).
As soon as we get into the UI side of things, I expect that I will be able to better undertstand what I need to
do to make my code work as I want it to, under most circumstances (specifically when my own machine is not being used the "server"). 
</br>

</br>
Live long and prosper :)
