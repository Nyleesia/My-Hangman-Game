# My-Hangman-Game
This is my third assignment in the GA TECH Bootcamp. 
I absolutely love the challenge! I hate it at times, but that only happens when I am frustrated (i.e. learning). 
I guess I am a bit like Bart Simpson. 
</br>
In reality, though, I enjoy figuring out how things work.
</br>
This assignment required the developer, (using vanilla(my fav flavor) JavaScript, to build a word
guess game (essentially hangman). 
</br>
The additional tabs (nsvigation bar tabs) are not yet functional, (i.e., they are disabled), as they were not required for the current project. However, I do enjoy the works of Shakespeare, and, I enjoy highlighting his work. Therefore, I intend to continuously contribute to this project, and, I hope one day, that Shakespeare afficionados, around the world, will be able to contribute to the library (currently an array) of words that makes this game so very enjoyable.

My code breaks/doesn't work as I would like, when I ask it to "quit(exit game)" while on a page hosted by github.
This was expected. However, if clicking the quit button does close the window, this is the intention. 
</br>
</br>
As soon as we get into the UI side of things, I expect that I will be able to better undertstand what I need to
do to make my code work as I want it to, under most circumstances (specifically when my own machine is not being
used the "server"). 
</br>
</br>
In closing:
Yoshi and I wish you long life and prosperity :)

PS. For now, please press sound at any time you want to hear this merry jaunt, but cannot, and vice versa. As long as the audio is playing, it will loop and continue to play. I find it peaceful, and hopeful. However, it is quite alright if you do not enjoy it. You can click the sound button while audio is playing to pause/stop it. If you would like to continue the playback, simply click on the sound button again.
